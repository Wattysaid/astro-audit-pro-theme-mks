  {
    question: 'Where does MKS Rural Services operate?',
    answer:
      'We are based in Fernvale and regularly travel through the Lockyer Valley, Somerset Region, and surrounding rural communities. For larger projects we can schedule work further afield — call to discuss the travel component.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide emergency breakdown support?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Phone 0405 837 584 and we will triage the situation. Our mobile workshop is stocked with common compressor, fan, and control parts so most repairs are completed during the first visit.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are you licensed and insured?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. We hold a QBCC mechanical services contractor licence and maintain all required insurances. Every job is documented with before/after checks and compliance notes where applicable.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help plan a new refrigeration or AC system?',
    answer:
      'We handle the lot — heat-load calculations, equipment selection, installation, commissioning, and training your team. You receive a written handover with warranty and maintenance recommendations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should equipment be serviced?',
    answer:
      'Most clients choose quarterly or biannual maintenance. High-duty sites like cold rooms or dusty agricultural sheds often benefit from monthly inspections. We will help you map out the right cadence.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer maintenance contracts or retainers?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Formal contracts secure priority booking, predictable pricing, and support our plan to employ apprentices for faster response times. Ask for a tailored proposal at admin@mksruralservices.com.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How transparent is your pricing?',
    answer:
      'Every quote lists labour, travel, and parts separately. If new information emerges mid-job, we stop, explain the options, and only proceed after approval. No surprises.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you provide documentation for insurance or compliance?',
    answer:
      'We issue written service reports, photos, and refrigerant records after every visit. These notes help with warranty claims, council audits, and insurance submissions.'
