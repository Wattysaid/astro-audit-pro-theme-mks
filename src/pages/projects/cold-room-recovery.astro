      <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-base text-slate-700">
        <li>• Restore cold room performance before peak harvest.</li>
        <li>• Stop escalating power costs caused by overheating equipment.</li>
        <li>• Put a preventative plan in place to avoid future downtime.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">What we discovered</h2>
    <p class="text-base text-slate-700">
      The compressor was operating outside its safe temperature range due to clogged condenser fins and restricted airflow. Refrigerant pressures were also drifting because of inconsistent servicing.
    </p>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li><strong>Thermal imaging</strong> revealed hot spots across the discharge line, pointing to a struggling compressor.</li>
      <li><strong>Airflow checks</strong> found heavy dust and vegetation blocking the condenser coil, limiting heat rejection.</li>
      <li><strong>Data logging</strong> showed cycling irregularities, a sign maintenance intervals were too casual for seasonal workloads.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Our solution</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Replaced the failing compressor using stocked parts from our mobile workshop to avoid interstate freight delays.</li>
      <li>Completed a full condenser and evaporator clean, reinstating design airflow and reducing compressor head pressure.</li>
      <li>Balanced refrigerant charge, verified fan speeds, and recalibrated control settings for stable cycling.</li>
      <li>Installed data loggers for continuous temperature monitoring and trained staff on daily visual inspections.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Results delivered</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Product loss dropped to less than 2% during a busy harvest window.</li>
      <li>Energy consumption improved by 18% within the first billing cycle.</li>
      <li>Quarterly preventative visits now align with picking season to keep the system in peak condition.</li>
