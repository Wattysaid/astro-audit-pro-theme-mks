      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Primary goals</h2>
      <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-base text-slate-700">
        <li>• Deliver even temperatures between sun-soaked living areas and shaded bedrooms.</li>
        <li>• Hide ductwork and grilles so the homestead’s heritage features remained untouched.</li>
        <li>• Keep geckos and insects out of the new system with proactive sealing and deterrents.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">What we discovered</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Roof space varied between 400–600 mm, limiting traditional duct runs and requiring slimline fabrication.</li>
      <li>Existing wiring pathways were perfect nesting spots for geckos, previously shorting a split system PCB.</li>
      <li>Open-plan living spaces needed independent control from sleep zones to manage family routines.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Our solution</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Collaborated with a mechanical engineer to design slimline ductwork with custom plenums for the heritage ceiling profile.</li>
      <li>Installed six zones with smart controllers so the family can tailor comfort to living, study, and bedroom wings.</li>
      <li>Sealed every wall penetration, added stainless steel mesh, and deployed pest deterrents within outdoor enclosures.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Results delivered</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Temperature variance now sits within 1.5°C across the home, even during summer storms.</li>
      <li>Energy usage dropped 12% compared with the previous mix of wall splits and heaters.</li>
      <li>No pest-related faults reported after six months thanks to improved sealing and deterrents.</li>
    </ul>
