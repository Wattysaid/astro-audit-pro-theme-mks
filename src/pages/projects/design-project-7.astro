        Large packing shed with produce conveyors, sorting equipment, and 40 staff working in shifts during peak season. Dust and humidity previously hampered operations.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Primary goals</h2>
      <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-base text-slate-700">
        <li>• Maintain stable temperatures for sensitive leafy produce.</li>
        <li>• Improve worker comfort and reduce fatigue during long shifts.</li>
        <li>• Handle dust ingress and frequent wash-downs with durable equipment.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">What we discovered</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>High doors and forklifts introduced hot air, undermining previous cooling efforts.</li>
      <li>Dust accumulation shortened filter life and reduced airflow.</li>
      <li>Staff relied on personal fans which disrupted produce handling areas.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Our solution</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Installed industrial evaporative cooling paired with filtration screens suited to dusty environments.</li>
      <li>Introduced air curtains at loading docks to minimise hot air ingress without impeding forklifts.</li>
      <li>Commissioned high-mounted destratification fans to keep conditioned air at worker level.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Results delivered</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-base text-slate-700">
      <li>Produce temperature variance reduced, preserving freshness through dispatch.</li>
      <li>Worker comfort improved, with reduced reliance on personal fans and fewer heat-related breaks.</li>
      <li>Filters now last their full service interval thanks to pre-filtration and easy-access maintenance points.</li>
